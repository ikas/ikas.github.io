[Sapiens][sapiens-link] got me from the first page. Having been very well recommended by a friend, the bar was set high from the start, but it's easy to understand why. The book describes the compelling, eloquent, sometimes harsh but always fascinating, journey of the evolution of **Homo Sapiens** as a biological species, how it has spread, dominating virtually all the planet, and ending today, where we stand.

The timeline of History in the first page reads like a travelling guide before going to some country for the first time. It shows the (many) similiraties we share with our ancestors 2 million years ago (FC!), the decisions we made in our evolutionary steps and how we have (or haven't) learnt from the mistakes we made.


DO SOMETHING COOL WITH THE TIMELINE OF HISTORY



TOPICS TO COVER:


How human history can be revealing of our present mistakes

How assuming "we dont know everything" helped us grow as a species

How this book can contribute to find our own view of the world, of each of us as beings, and Society as a whole

Puts everything into a new perspective - the historical term

They say that we die two times - when we stop breathing and when our name is referred the last time
