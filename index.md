  about_text_1: Hey, I am Henrique Pacheco. I'm 24 years old, and I was born (and currently live) in Braga, Portugal.
  about_text_2: I graduated from Universidade do Minho in Software Engineering (feb 2018), and I have also been working as a software engineer at Bsolus (since sep 2014), an e-commerce company based in Braga. Here, I've been part of an amazing team building Beevo, an product tailored for medium-large sized companies. This experience has given me the oportunity to work on projects such as the Super Bock Group online portal - the largest beverage distributor in Portugal -, or in partnership with the Swedish team of Commerz, a company based in Malmo, Sweden - more details of the project here.
