Hey, I am Henrique Pacheco. I'm 24 years old, and I was born (and currently live) in Braga, Portugal.

I graduated from Universidade do Minho in Software Engineering (feb 2018), and I have also been working as a software engineer at [Bsolus][bsolus-website] (since sep 2014), an e-commerce company based in Braga. Here, I've been part of an amazing team building [Beevo][beevo-website], an product tailored for medium-large sized companies. This experience has given me the oportunity to work on projects such as the [Super Bock Group][unicer-website]{:target="_blank"} online portal - the largest beverage distributor in Portugal -, or in partnership with the Swedish team of [Commerz][commerz-website], a company based in Malmo, Sweden - more details of the project [here][stockelb-blog].

In my free time I enjoy reading, having a beer with my friends, and I love coding with my girlfriend Mariana Capelo.
